# HungryForJustice


_Hungry for justice_ is a search application that provides restaurant information and crime data based on the user's input in the Orlando area. It is a fusion of HTML, CSS and MD Bootstrap on the Front-End. As for Back-End we used languages such as Javascript, JQuery and API's from Yelp and OPD Crimes. **This app was made because we wanted to help people feel safe when trying new or unfamiliar restaurants.**
